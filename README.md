# Stressometer
- In 21st century stress is considered as the cancer of the mind which does not allow the student to think about his study and responsibilities. 
- The factors which contribute towards the mental stress amongst students include parental pressure, peer pressure, health issues, financial conditions.The additive has been the pandemic of the Corona Virus. 
- The automation for student stress prediction in institutes and educational ogranizations has been very minimal.
- Seeking a solution to this problem, we developed a software with embedded Machine Learning Algorithm to predict Stress of a Student and updates the prediction results in the admin dashboard.
- Admin (Teacher/Administration) can monitor the stress level of his/her student.

## Objectives:
- To keep track of mental health of students.
- To provide quality information on how to fight any level of stress.
- To provide solutions regarding various academic pressure and mental health problems.
